- Pytests lets programmers write test cases as functions

- Pytests is a python package(3rd party hense requires a seperate installation)

- Pytest Excecutes and compiles Pass and Failed results

- Run pip install pytest to install pytest :)

- Unit tests are mostly added to same project they cover

- A simple pytest function has the following syntax: 
    def **name_of_test_functionality** () :
    followed by an assertion which outlines expected results of the fuctionality.
    
- Naming convention is important

- The module and functions containing test_ as their prefix will be excecuted as test functions

- Assert statement simply checks the function and raised an assert error if the condition specified after the assert is false

- Finally, run the test
